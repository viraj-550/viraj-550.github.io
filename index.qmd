I'm a senior-year honors student at Georgia State University, majoring in economics and mathematics with a deep interest in financial economics. I love working with numbers, and I am intrigued by the linkages between financial markets and global macro variables. Through my math and graduate-level economics courses, I have developed solid quantitative and programming skills.

Previously, I have worked as a research assistant in the Economics department at GSU, enhancing my data analysis and research skills. I was also associated with the Portfolio Management Team (PMT) at GSU as the Chief Economist. The PMT is a student-managed investment fund with an objective to outperform the S&P 500 Index on a risk-adjusted basis. This position gave me hands-on experience in analyzing macroeconomic trends and reporting them to other members.
